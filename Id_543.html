<p>While specific rules can vary slightly between editions and provincial amendments to the <strong>Canadian Electrical Code (CEC)</strong>, the <strong>minimum requirement</strong> for branch circuits from the distribution panel serving a garage for a single dwelling unit is typically <strong style="background-color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">at least one 15 A or 20 A branch circuit</strong>.<span style="background-color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"></span></p>
<p>The circuit must be a <strong>125 V receptacle branch circuit</strong> dedicated to the garage, which can also supply one or more permanently installed lighting outlets, but may not be required to be dedicated solely to the garage receptacles.</p>
<p>However, a more common and often required practice, especially with modern appliance use and the prevalence of electric vehicle charging, is to install:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One dedicated 120 V, 20 A branch circuit</strong> for receptacle outlets. This circuit usually <strong>cannot</strong> supply any other outlets (like lights or a garage door opener), except for readily accessible outdoor receptacle outlets on the same circuit, depending on the specific CEC rule in force.</li>
<li><strong>One or more additional branch circuits</strong> for lighting and other loads (like the garage door opener). These are often 15 A circuits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, for practical and often code-compliant purposes, <strong>two or more circuits</strong> are often installed, with at least one being a dedicated 20 A circuit for receptacles.</p>

<h3>ðŸ“š <strong>CEC Location</strong></h3>
<p>The rules regarding branch circuits for dwelling units, including garages, can generally be found in <strong>Section 26</strong> of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (the Safety Standard for Electrical Installations).</p>
<p>Specifically, you should look for the rules dealing with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule 26-654 f)</strong> series: Branch circuits for dwelling units</li>
<li><strong>Rule 26-726 c)</strong> series: Receptacle requirements for single dwelling units</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most precise and up-to-date information, including amendments specific to your region, you must consult the latest edition of the <strong>CEC, Part I</strong> and any local electrical inspection authority bulletins.</p>

<p>This video discusses <strong>Section 26 of the CEC</strong> regarding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdhE_y50Qq4">Section 26 CEC: Receptacles &amp; Residential branch circuits</a>, which covers the requirements for residential branch circuits, including those for garages.</p>
<p>Would you like me to search for the specific CEC rule number for garage receptacle branch circuits?
