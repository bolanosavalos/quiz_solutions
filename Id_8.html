<p>In the <strong>Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) 2024</strong>, when you’re running <strong>Cat5e communications cable through a plenum space (e.g., above a drop ceiling or in a duct where air circulates)</strong>, the cable must be a <strong>plenum-rated communications cable</strong>. In code terms, this means a <strong>CMP</strong>-rated cable. That rating correlates with <strong>FT-6</strong> flame/smoke performance under Canadian cabling fire tests which is required for exposed cables in plenum spaces. </p>
<h3>How to find it in CEC 2024 (using Table 19)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Table 19</strong> in the CEC is the primary table for identifying appropriate cable types and their designated applications. It lists types of insulated conductors and cables and, where they can be used. </li>
<li>For <strong>communications cables</strong> that will be outside of a raceway in a plenum air-handling space, the code requires a cable that meets the more stringent flame-spread and smoke-production tests for plenum use. In practice, this is shown by the <strong>CMP</strong> marking (Communications Plenum). </li>
<li>Table 19 (and related rules with Appendix B notes) tie the CEC designation to the flame test categories (FT-6) used in the <em>National Building Code of Canada</em> for plenums.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Answer to your multiple-choice</h3>
<p><strong>C. CMP</strong> — Communications Plenum rated cable is the correct choice for Cat5e wire run from <strong>Joint to Patch in a plenum space</strong> in accordance with CEC Table 19 and the applicable plenum fire-safety requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of other options (why they’re wrong):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. None of these</strong> — Not correct, because there <em>is</em> a required rating.</li>
<li><strong>B. FCC</strong> — “FCC” isn’t a cable type designation in CEC; it’s the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, unrelated here.</li>
<li><strong>D. SOP</strong> — “SOP” isn’t a standard CEC cable rating term.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Use <strong>CMP (plenum)</strong>-rated Category-rated communications cable for plenum runs per CEC Table 19 and fire/smoke code requirements.&nbsp;</p>
