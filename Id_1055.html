<p>The correct option is <strong>c) running coil leads.</strong></p>
<p>To reverse the rotation of a <strong>capacitor-start motor</strong>, you must reverse the connections of the <strong>running coil</strong> leads (the main winding) relative to the starting winding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong> Reversing the connections to the running coil changes the direction of the magnetic field it creates. This, in turn, changes the phase relationship between the magnetic fields of the running winding and the starting winding, causing the motor to start and run in the opposite direction.</li>
<li><strong>Why not the others?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>a) running and starting coil leads:</strong> Reversing <em>both</em> sets of leads simultaneously would maintain the same relative phase relationship between the two windings, and the motor's direction would not change.</li>
<li><strong>b) any of these:</strong> This is incorrect as reversing both windings or just the capacitor connection won't work.</li>
<li><strong>d) connection to the capacitor:</strong> Reversing the capacitor connection does <strong>not</strong> change the motor's rotation direction. The capacitor's role is to create a phase shift (approximately <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>9</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>âˆ˜</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">90^\circ</annotation></semantics></math></span>) for the starting winding's current relative to the running winding's current, which is necessary to generate the rotating magnetic field to start the motor. Reversing its connection doesn't alter this phase shift or the relative direction of the magnetic fields.</li><li><div><p><span>Which one would be better or "practical" to reverse running or starting ?</span></p><p>While reversing <b>either</b> the running winding or the starting winding will work electrically, the <b>standard and most practical procedure</b> is to reverse the <b>starting (auxiliary) winding.</b></p><p>Here is why:</p><p></p><h3>1. The Starting Winding is Simpler to Reverse</h3><p></p><ul><li><p><b>Less Current/Power:</b> The starting winding is only energized during the brief startup period (or continuously in a capacitor-run motor, but with lower current than the main winding). The main or running winding is connected to the full line voltage and carries the higher continuous operating current.</p></li><li><p><b>Physical Connection:</b> On motors designed to be easily reversible, the two leads for the <b>starting winding</b> are typically the ones brought out to the external terminal box or connection board for easy access and swapping. The running winding connections are sometimes tied internally to the main power lines (or sometimes in the case of dual voltage motors, the running winding is split).</p></li><li><p><b>Component Grouping:</b><span> The starting winding is wired in series with the </span><b><span>capacitor</span></b><span> and the </span><b><span>centrifugal switch</span></b><span> (if it's a capacitor-start only motor).<source-footnote><sup>1</sup></source-footnote></span> In a reversible setup, it is often simpler to swap the connection points of this entire series group relative to the running winding.<sources-carousel-inline><source-inline-chips><source-inline-chip></source-inline-chip></source-inline-chips></sources-carousel-inline></p><p></p></li></ul><p></p><h3>2. Standard Industry Practice</h3><p></p><p>Looking at motor diagrams and instructions for reversible motors, the design often makes the auxiliary (starting) winding leads the most accessible points for reversal, often with color-coded wires in a terminal box intended to be swapped.</p><p><b>In short:</b></p><ul><li><p><b>Electrically:</b> Reversing <b>Running</b> OR <b>Starting</b> is correct.</p></li><li><p><b>Practically:</b> Reversing the <b>Starting</b> winding is generally the preferred and easier method because those connections are the ones the manufacturer typically makes accessible for direction change.</p></li></ul></div></li>
