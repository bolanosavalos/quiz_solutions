<p>The correct option is <strong>c) running coil leads</strong>.</p>
<p>To reverse the rotation of a <strong>capacitor-start motor</strong>, you must reverse the connections of the <strong>running coil</strong> leads (the main winding) relative to the starting winding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong> Reversing the connections to the running coil changes the direction of the magnetic field it creates. This, in turn, changes the phase relationship between the magnetic fields of the running winding and the starting winding, causing the motor to start and run in the opposite direction.</li>
<li><strong>Why not the others?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>a) running and starting coil leads:</strong> Reversing <em>both</em> sets of leads simultaneously would maintain the same relative phase relationship between the two windings, and the motor's direction would not change.</li>
<li><strong>b) any of these:</strong> This is incorrect as reversing both windings or just the capacitor connection won't work.</li>
<li><strong>d) connection to the capacitor:</strong> Reversing the capacitor connection does <strong>not</strong> change the motor's rotation direction. The capacitor's role is to create a phase shift (approximately <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>9</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>âˆ˜</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">90^\circ</annotation></semantics></math></span>) for the starting winding's current relative to the running winding's current, which is necessary to generate the rotating magnetic field to start the motor. Reversing its connection doesn't alter this phase shift or the relative direction of the magnetic fields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
