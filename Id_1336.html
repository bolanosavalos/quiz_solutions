<p>In a hot air furnace system, a low-voltage thermostat wire is connected <strong>in series with the coil</strong> (Option <strong>a</strong>).</p>
<h3>How the Circuit Works</h3>
<p>To understand why it is in series, think of the thermostat as a simple switch. For a furnace to turn on, electricity must flow from the power source (a transformer) through the control components to the load (the relay or contactor coil).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Power Source:</strong> A transformer steps down house voltage (120V) to <strong>24V</strong> (low voltage).</li>
<li><strong>The "Switch":</strong> The thermostat acts as the switch in the circuit.</li>
<li><strong>The "Load":</strong> The "coil" is the electromagnetic part of a relay or gas valve that, when energized, physically opens the gas flow or starts the heating sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the thermostat "calls for heat," its internal switch closes. This allows the 24V current to flow through the thermostat wire and directly into the <strong>coil</strong>. Because the current must pass through the thermostat to reach the coil, they are connected in <strong>series</strong>. If they were in parallel, the coil would receive power regardless of whether the thermostat was "on" or "off."</p>

<h3><strong>Why other options are incorrect:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel with the coil:</strong> This would mean the coil is always powered, making the thermostat unable to turn the furnace off.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel with the gas valve:</strong> Similar to the coil, this would bypass the control logic.</li>
<li><strong>Series with the fan:</strong> While the thermostat can control a fan (G wire), the primary heating call (W wire) is specifically for the heating sequence, and the fan is usually triggered separately by the furnace control board once the plenum gets hot.</li>
</ul>
