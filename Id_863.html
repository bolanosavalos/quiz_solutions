<p>The correct answer is <strong>C. DIAC</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>DIAC</strong> (Diode for Alternating Current) is a bidirectional trigger device designed specifically to conduct current in both directions once its breakover voltage is reached. This makes it the ideal component to provide the symmetrical trigger pulses required to fire a <strong>TRIAC</strong> during both the positive and negative alternations of an AC cycle.</p>
<h3>Why the other options are incorrect:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diode:</strong> A standard diode is a unidirectional device that only conducts in one direction, making it unable to trigger a TRIAC symmetrically across both half-cycles.</li>
<li><strong>BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor):</strong> This is a current-controlled DC device; while it can act as a switch, it is not designed as a bidirectional breakdown trigger for AC phase control.</li>
<li><strong>IGBT (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor):</strong> This is a high-power DC switching transistor; like the BJT, it is unidirectional in its main conduction path and requires a controlled gate voltage rather than relying on bidirectional voltage breakover.</li>
</ul>
