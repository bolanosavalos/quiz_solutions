<p>The Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) allows the use of standard <strong>armored cable (Type AC)</strong> in <strong>commercial areas</strong> (and residential areas, although other options may be more common).</p>
<p>Based on CEC Rule 12-600, armored cable is permitted for both <strong>exposed and concealed locations</strong>. However, it is <strong>not permitted</strong> in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locations where it will be subjected to <strong>physical damage</strong>.</li>
<li>Locations with <strong>corrosive fumes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Direct burial</strong> in earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The options related to healthcare facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic care areas</strong> and <strong>critical care areas</strong> are generally classified as Patient Care Areas (Section 24). These areas have special grounding, isolation, and wiring requirements, and while certain types of armored or metal-clad (MC) cable might be permitted if specifically listed for the application and code sections (like Section 24), the broader "residential" or "commercial" areas are more commonly and generally cited as acceptable uses for standard Type AC armored cable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, among the choices provided, <strong>commercial areas</strong> is an acceptable general location for standard armored cable use under the CEC.</p>
