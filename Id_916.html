<p>The correct answer is <strong>C. By reprogramming to another function key.</strong></p>
<p>In a Distributed Control System (DCS), if a specific physical key on an interface unit (like an Operator Station keyboard) fails due to mechanical wear or "excessive use," the most effective temporary fix is to remap that specific software command to an unused or less critical functional key.</p>
<h3>Why Option C is the Best Choice</h3>
<p>In industrial environments, stopping production to replace hardware isn't always feasible. Reprogramming allows the operator to maintain control of the process immediately without needing new parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software Flexibility:</strong> Most DCS software (like Honeywell Experion, Emerson DeltaV, or ABB 800xA) allows for the reassignment of "Soft Keys" or "Functional Keys" within the engineering configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Downtime:</strong> Unlike rebooting (which might not fix a mechanical failure) or cleaning (which could damage sensitive electronics), remapping is a non-invasive software change.</li>
</ul>
