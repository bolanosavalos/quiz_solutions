<p>For <strong>extra-low-voltage wiring (such as HVAC control wiring) that must be run through a plenum or air-handling space</strong>, the Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) requires the cable to be <strong>rated for installation in a plenum space</strong> - meaning it must have appropriate flame-spread and smoke characteristics suitable for that environment. CEC references the <strong>National Building Code of Canada (NBC) flame spread requirements (FT ratings)</strong> for cables in plenum spaces and requires a plenum-rated jacket (e.g., FT-6) for exposed cables not in conduit.</p>
<p>Among the answer choices provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a. Nylon cable</strong> - not a recognized required type for plenum wiring.</li>
<li><strong>b. Flat conductor cable</strong> - a cable construction, <em>not</em> specifically plenum-rated on its own.</li>
<li><strong>c. Non-metallic sheathed cable (NM)</strong> - this is <strong>not permitted</strong> in plenum spaces unless it is specifically rated for plenum use, which standard NM is not.</li>
<li>**<strong>d. Control and instrumentation cable</strong> - this is the correct category of cable for HVAC extra-low-voltage control circuits; <em>provided</em> it is <strong>plenum-rated</strong> (e.g., FT-6 or equivalent jacket suitable for plenum use). </li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <strong>Correct Answer: d. Control and instrumentation cable</strong> (with a plenum-rated jacket suitable for HVAC plenum spaces per CEC/NBC fire-safety requirements). </p>
<p>In practice, you’d select control/instrumentation cable that is specifically listed for plenum use (with appropriate flame/spread rating such as FT-6) when routing through ventilation plenums in accordance with code requirements. </p>
