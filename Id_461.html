          }    <strong></strong>Based on standard electrical codes and practices, the answer is often <strong>c) terminal blocks</strong> (specifically, those that are not rated for dissimilar metals).</style>





<p>However, since a direct, unapproved method is the general principle that's forbidden (as detailed in the previous response), let's re-evaluate the options in the context of what is generally <strong>unacceptable</strong> for connecting the two dissimilar metals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a) Split Bolt Connection:</strong> A split bolt can be used for copper-to-aluminum connections, but only if it is specifically <strong>listed for the purpose (CU/AL rated)</strong> and an anti-oxidant joint compound is applied.</li>
<li><strong>b) Compression Lug Connection:</strong> These are commonly used for large copper-to-aluminum wires, but they <strong>must be dual-rated (CU/AL)</strong> and used with an anti-oxidant compound.</li>
<li><strong>c) Terminal Blocks:</strong> Many standard terminal blocks, particularly those on older or non-specialized electrical equipment, are only rated for <strong>copper (CU)</strong>. Using them to directly connect aluminum is a common source of failure and is <strong>typically not approved</strong> unless the block is explicitly marked with a CU/AL rating.</li>
<li><strong>d) Bimetallic or Tined Metal Strips:</strong> These are actually <strong>key components</strong> of approved connections. Bimetallic strips (like those found in certain connectors) or terminals with a <strong>tin plating</strong> are designed to prevent the direct, corrosive contact of raw copper and raw aluminum.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Answer Choice: c) terminal blocks</strong></h3>
<p>While all the listed connections <em>can</em> be used if they are specifically <strong>CU/AL rated</strong>, <strong>standard, non-rated terminal blocks</strong> are the most common example in electrical work of a connection device that is <strong>typically not approved</strong> for aluminum-to-copper wiring.</p>
<p>The general rule is that <strong>any device or connector not explicitly marked CU/AL or CO/ALR is not approved for connecting copper and aluminum conductors.</strong> Standard terminal blocks often fall into this unrated category.</p>
