<p>The correct option is <strong>d) overexciting the field</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<p>A synchronous motor's power factor can be controlled by adjusting its <strong>field excitation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lagging Power Factor</strong> ðŸ“‰: This usually means the motor is <strong>under-excited</strong>. It's consuming reactive power from the line.</li>
<li><strong>Correcting to Unity or Leading Power Factor</strong> ðŸ“ˆ: By <strong>overexciting the field</strong> (increasing the DC current to the rotor), the motor will begin to supply reactive power back to the AC system. This makes the motor operate at a <strong>unity</strong> or <strong>leading</strong> power factor, which corrects the initial lagging condition.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Synchronous Motor Power Factor Control</h2>
<p>The relationship between field excitation and power factor in a synchronous motor is often visualized using <strong>V-curves</strong> .</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Under-Excited Field (Low <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">I_f</annotation></semantics></math></span>)</strong>: The motor operates at a <strong>lagging</strong> power factor (like an induction motor or a simple inductor).</li>
<li><strong>Normal Excitation</strong>: The motor operates at a <strong>unity</strong> power factor.</li>
<li><strong>Over-Excited Field (High <span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">I_f</annotation></semantics></math></span>)</strong>: The motor operates at a <strong>leading</strong> power factor (like a capacitor).</li>
</ul>
<p>This ability to operate at a leading power factor when overexcited is why synchronous motors are sometimes used specifically for <strong>power factor correction</strong> in industrial plants, in which case they are called <strong>synchronous condensers</strong> or <strong>compensators</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why the Other Options Are Incorrect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>a) adding a capacitor</strong>: While adding a <strong>static capacitor bank</strong> is the most common way to correct lagging power factor for <em>inductive loads</em> in general, the question specifically asks what you can do <em>when troubleshooting a synchronous motor</em>. The motor itself has the built-in capability to correct its own power factor through field excitation.</li>
<li><strong>b) removing some load</strong>: Removing load will reduce the armature current but won't fundamentally change the motor's operating power factor <em>at a given excitation level</em>. If the motor is under-excited, it will remain lagging, just at a lower current.</li>
<li><strong>c) under exciting the field</strong>: This is the cause of the lagging power factor, not the correction. It would make the power factor even <em>more</em> lagging.</li>
</ul>
