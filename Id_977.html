<p>The correct answer is <strong>Direct current.</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)</strong> achieves electric frictionless braking, also known as <strong>DC Injection Braking</strong>, by inserting <strong>Direct current (DC)</strong> into the stator windings of an AC induction motor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it Works:</strong> When DC is applied to the stator, it creates a stationary, non-rotating magnetic field. As the rotor, which is still spinning due to inertia, passes through this fixed magnetic field, currents are induced in the rotor windings. The interaction between the induced rotor currents and the stationary magnetic field creates a <strong>braking torque</strong> that opposes the rotation, bringing the motor to a stop.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> This method provides a smooth and quick stop for a motor and is "frictionless" in the sense that it doesn't involve mechanical brake pads or discs.</li>
</ul>
